[*NOTEtoALL* Hey, as we move forward with the project, keep 
track of changes that arise. Use the brackets as notes, 
either to yourself, or to other group members. If it's to
another group member, use their name first, and then a 
suggestion or request. As a group member, try to look over
it whenever you look at code. Idaelly send an email or 
notify the person you have a request to, then they should 
be able to easily find it with their name. All of the
bracketed notes should be deleted before submitting the
project. Also, we'll have to figure out a style of sorts. 
Otherwise, we'll have to assign a person to do their own
style on the whole thing. Suggestions and such would be 
helpful.]

About this project:
    
    We are working on a course project at the University of
    Illinois at Chicago. The project requires that we use
    specific tools and resources. QT Creator, Deoxygen and 
    GitHub (along with Git) are among those required. 
    
    The goal of our specific project is to create a mini-
    game, which has a few inspiring titles. The battle 
    system is most inspired by the popular titles from the
    Pokemon series. Where you have a defending character
    and an opposing character, with various Pokemon. In our
    case, instead of Pokemon we will have a variety of 
    hacking tools, and a debugger. [This may change, and
    has already.][*ALEX* this is a good place to talk about 
    the idea you had, for the battle system]. The world 
    where the "Hero" will traverse consists of a node
    structure, similar to the Mario world maps from Super
    Mario Bros. 3. [Ideally we will make it similar to the 
    zelda world, but only if we can figure out some of the
    fancier mechanics of QT, or programming in general.]
    
    [*JAMIE* here's what Alex and I were  thinking for 
    the pause menus, incase you need some reference. Also, 
    add some of your own ideas to the project. Should look
    good in a resume, or just to have. Goes for any 
    section.] Aside from the main game and story line, we 
    will have two more key components of the game. The 
    pause menu and the story board. 
    
    The pause menu will have two modes [*JAMIE* as of right
    now, if you think of anything else, go for it.] the 
    map mode, where you are able to access your inventory, 
    modify, drop, equip, or inspect. While in the map mode, 
    you will also be able to save, load or exit from the 
    game. [*JAMIE* If you're able to get the image of the 
    character on there, then it would be a nice addition, 
    at least have the changes noted somewhere when an item
    is equipped or consumed.] The hero's stats will appear
    in this menu, and potions or items can be used to aid 
    or enhance the hero in some way. Finally, a return to 
    map function will be implemented here. 
    
    The story board seciton of the project will be the
    starting of the story, along with the initial start
    menu. This menu will include the following options:
    "New Game", "Continue" (which will be grayed out if
    there are no saved games), "Options" [** assuming we 
    have any], "Load" (to load a specific save file) and
    "Exit". [*JUNE* there was also talk of having a game
    plus option, which can be hidden, or grayed depending
    on how it's implemented. May or may not be an option].
    {** if we get to multiple worlds, then we'll have 
    parts of the story in the middle.] The story board
    section will then end the game, show the credits and 
    return to the main menu.
